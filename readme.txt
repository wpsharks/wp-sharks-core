The WP Sharks Core is a WordPress plugin that serves as a framework for other plugins by the WP Sharks™ team.

== Description ==

This plugin (by itself) does nothing. It merely serves as a framework for other plugins by the WP Sharks™ team; i.e., it contains code that is resused by other plugins that we develop. In other words, instead of shipping each plugin with our full framework, we provide the framework as an installable plugin. This allows you to run lots of other plugins that we offer, without the added overhead of loading our framework in each one. Instead, it is loaded just once by this core.

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation (Recommended) =

Wait until you're prompted; i.e., wait until another plugin developed by the WP Sharks™ team asks you to install it. For instance, when one of our plugins requires this framework it will let you know that. At that time you can install it on-demand from inside your WordPress Dashboard following on-screen instructions.

= Manual Installation (Optional) =

1. Upload the `/wp-sharks-core` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress®.
3. _Now, feel free to activate another plugin which depends on this core._

== Software Requirements ==

In addition to the [WordPress Requirements](http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/), The WP Sharks™ Core framework requires:

- PHP 7.0.1+

== Changelog ==

= v160228 =

- Initial release.
